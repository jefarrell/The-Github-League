# The-Github-League
Celebrating Builders of Open-Source Software

>Do you often wonder about the people putting in the long hours to build open-source software?  Do you feel they should be celebrated?  
>Why isn't there memorabilia commemorating these heroes of code?  Well, now there is.  Welcome to The Github League.

>The GitHub League seeks to explore the idea of celebrity, statistics and memorabilia in the context of software development, by creating trading cards based on the most prolific GitHub users. 
>Available data including repositories and frequency of commits provides a base for data visualizations and card statistics.

>The GitHub League consists of the ten most active users within a one-year period, from August 24, 2014-August 25, 2015.  
>In this context, "most active" means most commits to public repositories.  
>We were inspired by, and based our ranking system off of, work by GitHub user [paulmillr](https://github.com/paulmillr/) and his [git.io/top](http://git.io/top) page.

>A limited-edition run of cards was printed, to be sold at the [Internet Yami-Ichi Art Fair](http://yami-ichi.biz/nyc/) in New York City on September 12, 2015.
